# Open Source Starter (HTML/CSS/JS)

A beginner-friendly, pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project you can extend over time. Use this to practice forking, branching, making changes, and opening pull requests.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools or server required.
- Add a todo, mark complete, delete, or clear completed. Your list saves in your browser.

## Contributing (beginner flow)

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch for your change (example: `feat/add-dark-mode` or `fix/typo-readme`).
4. Make your edit in HTML/CSS/JS only. Open `index.html` in your browser to test.
5. Commit with a clear message (example: `feat: add dark mode toggle`).
6. Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details, tips, and ideas.

## Project structure

- `index.html`: The page markup
- `styles.css`: The styles

## Idea backlog (pick one and open a PR)

- Add a dark mode toggle and remember the preference
- Edit todo titles in place
- Filters: All / Active / Completed
- Keyboard accessibility improvements
- Improve mobile spacing and tap targets
- Basic in-browser unit tests (no tooling)
- Character counter for the input
- Drag-and-drop reordering
